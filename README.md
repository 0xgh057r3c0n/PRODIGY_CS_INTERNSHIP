# Caesar Cipher Program 

## Overview
`task1.py` is a command-line tool for encrypting and decrypting messages using the Caesar Cipher technique. It features an interactive menu allowing users to select options for encryption, decryption, and exiting the program. This tool is designed as an introduction to basic cryptography principles in Python.

## Features
- **Encrypt Messages**: Shift characters in a message to generate encrypted text.
- **Decrypt Messages**: Reverse the shift to retrieve the original message.
- **Custom Shift Value**: Users specify the shift value to control the cipher's rotation.

## Requirements
The script requires **Python 3** and the `colorama` library for colorized command-line output.

### Installation
1. Install Python 3 if itâ€™s not already installed. You can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install dependencies using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
python3 task1.py
```

The script will display a banner and offer options for encryption, decryption, and quitting.

## Example Output
An example interaction with the script:
